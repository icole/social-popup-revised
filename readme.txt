This plugin is a revised version of the one developed by timersys (http://www.masquewordpress.com/). It has been modified to allow for the user to set a shortcode to enable and configure the plugin on an individual page or post rather than have a settings page systems wide.

== Description ==

The following shortcode needs to be placed in either a post or page visual editor with any of the specified options.

[social-popup company="Unique to comapny page and no spaces" title="" message="" closeable = "true/false" advclode = "true/false" image_location="URL of image" image_link="URL img should redirect to" twitter="true/false" twuser="" facebook="true/false" fburl="" pintrest = "true/false" ptuser = "" google = "true/false" gplusurl = "" {twitter,facebook,pintrest,or gplus}_affiliate="pixel url"]

Popup dissapears if a user click on any social button.

Popup dissapears if a user click outside of the popup ( Can be disabled )

Popup dissapears if a user click in close button ( Can be disabled )

When a use clicks a button, a cookie will be created , so the user wont see the popup next time he visits the site.

After you activate your plugin, go to the settings page to configure your buttons and enable the popup.

You can also configure background opacity.
